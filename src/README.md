Project 1: Tokenizer
====================
# Instructions:

Initially as you run my program, it builds a list; It asks the user to enter a
word/sentence to create a Linked List. After the List is made and the user no
longer wants to add the the List a menu comes out asking if they want to view
an element of the list, if the want to tokenize a word from the List or if
they would like to terminate the program. If they choose to view a certain
element in the Linked list, the used must press '!' followed by the ID number;
to tokenize, they must input 't' and then put the ID of the element they want
tokenized. Then the word is freed and the process continues until the user
chooses 'q' to quit the program.


You should document your tokenizer in this file.

This file is written in the refreshingly simple `markdown` text
formatting language.
